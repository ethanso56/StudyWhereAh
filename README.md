# StudyWhereAh
An android application that helps students find study spots!


Motivation
 
You are one who takes learning very seriously, furthermore, imagine that there is an assignment due 2359 tonight and you need a place to make it happen. 
However, things aren’t in your favour. Your neighbour’s dog just couldn’t stop barking, and your home is just too noisy for a good study session. How do you find the best study spot? 
Where do you go to? How would you know if the nearest McDonald’s is full? What if there was a hidden gem, a café just around the corner? Our app “Study where ah??” is here to help you!
 
Aim
 
Our app aims to provide a sleek solution in finding a customised, conducive study spot in Singapore for you. 
Recommendations are given based on the user’s preferences which include location, crowdedness, dining options and availability of charging ports at the study spot. 
Logged in Users can input their own newly found study spots and even contribute them to the crowd sourced database, as such, information can be shared among users and the 
application gets better in recommending spots as people continue using it..


User Stories
 
1. 	As a student who cannot study at home, I want to quickly know of the nearest location I can study at.
 
2. 	Together with my friends, I want to know of a study location that can accommodate all of us.

6. 	After visiting a place, I would like to share with others my experience and enable them to enjoy the same awesome study spot I have just found



Scope(features)

Mobile application
 
Core functionality: Our database aggregates details on study places across Singapore. These study places are curated by ourselves and contributed by users of the application. With the “Add a place” feature, users will be able to save a special study spot that they have just discovered on their device, and/or in our database. 
The database forms the backbone of our application, enabling a strong pool of information that enable us to best recommend a study spot to the app’s users. Once the app is launched, users can find a recommendation using the “Get place” feature. This feature allows users to choose their preferences for the type of study spot they are looking for, thereafter our algorithm will take into account the various preferences set by the user, and return the best suited location based on the following parameters. :
 
·   	The location of the user
·   	Crowd levels
·   	Dining options near study spots
·   	Availability of charging ports
·   	Travel time for the user


Profitability: Some possible means in which our application could be profitable would be the tying in of cafes and fast food chains. For Instance,cafes could subscribe to a boost in their ranking within the recommendations in order to increase off-peak crowd levels. In an ideal scenario where there is a high number of users for our application, cafes and fast food chains can further market their menus and promotions through our application by including such information within each study spot’s details.
