An android application that helps students find study spots!


Motivation
 
You are one who takes learning very seriously, furthermore, imagine that there is an assignment due 2359 tonight and you need a place to make it happen. 
However, things aren’t in your favour. Your neighbour’s dog just couldn’t stop barking, and your home is just too noisy for a good study session. How do you find the best study spot? 
Where do you go to? How would you know if the nearest McDonald’s is full? What if there was a hidden gem, a café just around the corner? Our app “Study where ah??” is here to help you!
 
Aim
 
Our app aims to provide a sleek solution in finding a customised, conducive study spot in Singapore for you. 
Recommendations are given based on the user’s preferences which include location, crowdedness, dining options and availability of charging ports at the study spot. 
Logged in Users can input their own newly found study spots and even contribute them to the crowd sourced database, as such, information can be shared among users and the 
application gets better in recommending spots as people continue using it..
